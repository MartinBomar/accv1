### Domo Sugarforce custom map selector
This project is for testing purposes of the Sugarforce app developed by Domo Inc.

## DESCRIPTION
Given a set of territories in a previously configured dataset, the user will be able to display maps from specific countries or regions (depending if certain country is available in the map settings for Phoenix) without having several cards or the need to refresh a page/dashboard.

This was created using the Sugarforce app technology from Domo. Documentation for starter kit can be found here: https://developer.domo.com/docs/dev-studio/dev-studio-overview

However, this app was modified in the most part, the only feats kept intact are the Input Form used for AppDB Data Storage and the main nav. The "opportunities" section was renamed as the map chart and Domo Phoenix was used (https://domoapps.github.io/domo-phoenix/#/). Additionally, some VainillaJS was used in the functionality of the selector and its result.

Personal areas of opportunity I'll be working in the near future
~~1. Datepicker for Input Form date field. It is currently a simple textbox.~~ ###COMMITED 02/24/2021
2. Add hidden parameters to the drop down list to save into AppDB Storage. This will eliminate the need of a custom dataflow.
4. Query based on drop down list selection to display results table next to the map div
5. Drill Down functionality for the maps

Collaborations are welcome!
